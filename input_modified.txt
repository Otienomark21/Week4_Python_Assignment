THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO DEMONSTRATE BASIC FILE I/O OPERATIONS AND ERROR HANDLING IN PYTHON.

FUNCTIONALITY: THE CORE LOGIC IS ENCAPSULATED IN THE PROCESS_FILE FUNCTION. IT TAKES A FILENAME AS INPUT AND ATTEMPTS TO PERFORM THE FOLLOWING STEPS:

READ: IT OPENS THE ORIGINAL FILE AND READS ITS ENTIRE CONTENT.

MODIFY: IT CONVERTS THE READ CONTENT TO ALL UPPERCASE LETTERS.

WRITE: IT CREATES A NEW FILE, APPENDS _MODIFIED TO THE ORIGINAL FILENAME, AND WRITES THE UPPERCASE CONTENT TO IT.

ERROR HANDLING: IT USES A TRY...EXCEPT BLOCK TO CATCH A FILENOTFOUNDERROR IF THE FILE DOESN'T EXIST. IT ALSO INCLUDES A GENERAL IOERROR CATCH TO HANDLE OTHER POTENTIAL ISSUES LIKE PERMISSION ERRORS.

USER INTERACTION: THE MAIN PART OF THE SCRIPT PROMPTS THE USER FOR A FILENAME AND THEN CALLS THE PROCESS_FILE FUNCTION. A SUCCESS OR FAILURE MESSAGE IS PRINTED TO THE CONSOLE BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF THE FUNCTION CALL.
